Fizzim2
======

A FSM (Finite State Machine) tools for Verilog HDL.

This project was forked from [Fizzim](http://www.fizzim.com), a very good works, but [**Fizzim2**](https://github.com/balanx/fizzim2) enhances the following features.

- all java, NOT need perl
- add HDL-View, what you see is what you get
- focus on design entry, ignore some features e.g. 'statebit' which can be accomplished by synthesizer
- more explicitly in use, change OUTPUTS type from 'statebit, regdp, comb, flag' to 'onstate, ontransit, ontransit-dd, hold'
- add 'signals' & 'page_mode' feature, support complicated FSM design model
- modify priority feature, use 'UserAttrs' of transition as priority
- 'reset_state' can be set by right-click on state
- fix some bugs

So Fizzim2 will NOT be compatible with the original Fizzim.
